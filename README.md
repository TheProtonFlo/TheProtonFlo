Hey ! ( ･∀･)ﾉﾞ

I'm ProtonFlo, a lil'dev who want to progress into game programming for my studies and to help later to make my project come true ! :)

I actually learn C# for Unity and make prototype of my game project ! (and have a lot to learn !)

Will be open to any help ! I'm new after all and have a lot to discover :)


If you want to contact me : well wait a little, i don't have a specific mail for only Github now (^^ゞ
