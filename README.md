Hey ! (｡･∀･)ﾉﾞ

I'm ProtonFlo, a lil'dev who want to progress into game programming for my studies and to help later to make my project come true ! :)

I actually learn C# for Unity and make prototype of my game project ! ( i had a lot :,) ) 
and Shell to use Git and Github commit correctly (´。＿。｀)

Will be open to any help ! I'm new after all and have a lot to discover :)


If you want to contact me : well wait a little, i don't have a specific mail for only Github now (^^ゞ
