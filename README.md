Hey ! ( ･∀･)ﾉﾞ

I'm ProtonFlo, a lil'dev who want to progress into game programming for my studies and to help later to make my project come true ! :)

I actually learn C# for Unity and make prototype of my game project ! (and have a lot to learn !)

Maybe i'll post here some of my game ! who knows...
